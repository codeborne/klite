# 1.7.0
* core: TSIDGenerator can now be used with custom classes outside TSID companion
* core/jdbc: Any.toValues()/BaseCrudRepository.persister() will now return KProperty1 keys, not Strings for added type-safety.
  - If you need to use String keys, use `toValues().mapKeys { it.key.name }`
  - You may get "column specified more than once" errors if you have code like `entity.toValues() + ("hello" to 123)`, replace `"hello"` with `Entity::hello` in that case
  - It is now recommended to use `toValues()` for both providing values and skipping them, e.g. `entity.toValues(Entity::field1 = "other value, skip = setOf(Entity::field2))` - this avoids creation of intermediate maps and is faster
* json: `toJsonValues()` introduced for the cases when you want to modify how an entity is serialized into json (e.g. remove some keys)
* jdbc: introduce @Column annotation to override DB column names for entity fields, previous internal typealias `Column` renamed to `ColName`
* jdbc: make it possible to override how Enum/Array is stored using JdbcConverter, default to toString() for enums
* jdbc: db.upsert() will now work as SQL MERGE for non-Postgres databases
* server: use<>() call will fail if called inside context {} for Extensions that need Server-level initialization
* server: allow body in DELETE requests, as sometimes people do that #117
* json: improved detection if inline classes should be rendered as their value type or a string
* jackson: DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_TRAILING_TOKENS is now enabled by default
* smtp: SmtpEmailSender will now log the successful email sent (to address and subject)
* openapi:
  * skip @AttrParam from OpenAPI spec
  * allow specifying SwaggerUI config parameters in openApi() function
  * skip @ApiResponse responseCode=default

The release is **not fully backwards-compatible**, however most old functions are provided as @Deprecated.

This will migrate the most important parts:
`find -name '*.kt' -exec sed -ri 's/klite.json./klite.jackson./; s/mapOfNotNull/notNullValues/; /db\.(query|select)/{N; s/db\.query/db.xxxselect/g; s/db\.select/db.query/g; s/mapOf/listOf/g; s/emptyMap/emptyList/g};' {} \; -exec sed -ri 's/db\.xxxselect/db\.select/; s/(db.update\(.*, )mapOf\((.*?\)), (mapOf\(.*?\))\)/\1\3, \2/; s/(db.delete\(.*, )mapOf\((.*?)\)/\1\2/' {} \;`

**Beware**: if you use the replacement above, then make sure that no deprecated query/select usages are left, i.e. check that all "where" maps are replaced with lists/varargs, which is done automatically only if on the same or next line.

You may also use IDEA migration of deprecations, but it will most likely [break code formatting, etc](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-24870).
Also, you may need to add some imports manually.
