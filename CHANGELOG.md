The release is **not fully backwards-compatible**, however most old functions are provided as @Deprecated.

This will migrate the most important parts:
`find -name '*.kt' -exec sed -ri 's/klite.json./klite.jackson./; s/mapOfNotNull/notNullValues/; /db\.(query|select)/{N; s/db\.query/db.xxxselect/g; s/db\.select/db.query/g; s/mapOf/listOf/g; s/emptyMap/emptyList/g};' {} \; -exec sed -ri 's/db\.xxxselect/db\.select/; s/(db.update\(.*, )mapOf\((.*?\)), (mapOf\(.*?\))\)/\1\3, \2/; s/(db.delete\(.*, )mapOf\((.*?)\)/\1\2/' {} \;`

**Beware**: if you use the replacement above, then make sure that no deprecated query/select usages are left, i.e. check that all "where" maps are replaced with lists/varargs, which is done automatically only if on the same or next line.

You may also use IDEA migration of deprecations, but it will most likely [break code formatting, etc](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-24870).
Also, you may need to add some imports manually.
